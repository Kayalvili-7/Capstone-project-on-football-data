## ðŸ”Ž Key Analysis and Findings  

### 1. Performance Analysis  
- **Top Goal Scorers**: Aron Johannsson (93 goals) and Jozy Altidore (65 goals).  
- **Top Teams**:  
  - Best home club: *Borussia Verein* (410 goals).  
  - Best away club: *Borussia Dortmund* (282 goals).  
- **Probabilities**:  
  - Home team winning â†’ 45%.  
  - Goal scored after substitution â†’ 84%.  
- **Hypothesis Testing**: No significant difference between home and away goals (p-value > 0.05).

### 2. Player Profile and Market Value Analysis  
- **Regression Models**:  
  - Linear Regression: Very weak relationship between assists and market value (RÂ² = 0.0047).  
  - Multiple Linear Regression: Low predictive power (RÂ² = 0.0044).  
- **Contract Insights**:  
  - Club ID 18 â†’ 200+ expiring contracts.  
  - Club ID 24 â†’ 190 expiring contracts.  
  - Midfielder with contract expiring in 2026 valued at **â‚¬25M+**.  
- **Player Demographics**:  
  - 80% of players are **right-footed**.  
  - Top player-producing nations: USA (2500+), Germany (~1000).

### 3. Team and Competition Analysis  
- **Home vs Away Wins**: L1 competition had the highest home (536) and away (332) wins.  
- **Goals per Game**: USC & DFL averaged **13 goals per game**.  
- **Attendance**: DFL attracted the **highest average attendance (81,360)**.  
- **Competitive Balance**: POCP & USC showed the most balanced competition (smallest goal difference).  

---

### 4. Event and Substitution Analysis  
- **Most Active Competition (Events)**: L1 â†’ 992 substitutions, 104 goals, 47 cards.  
- **Timing Insights**:  
  - Peak activity between **61-75 minutes**: 2749 substitutions, 33 goals, 175 assists.  
- **Refereeing**:  
  - Chi-Square test â†’ No significant association between red cards and losing (p = 0.90).  

---

### 5. Machine Learning Models  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Predicted attendance with **62% accuracy**, better at identifying high-attendance matches.  
- **K-Means Clustering**:  
  - Younger players (<30) spread across all clusters.  
  - Older players (>30) grouped in lower performance clusters.  
- **Logistic Regression**: ROC curve (AUC = 0.55) â†’ Limited predictive power for goal prediction.
